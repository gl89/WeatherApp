This project is one of the intermediate level projects issued by https://www.freecodecamp.org.

This application revolves around the DarkSky and Ipinfo APIs and provides local weather information based on a users geolocation. 
Functionally we are required to have a few functionalities:
  1. It must make a JSON request to any API the programer wishes to use. I used DarkSky's and Ipinfo's APIs. 
  2. It must take the JSON response and consume it.
  3. It must show the local temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. It must be toggable.
  4. It must have different icon that corresponds to each type of weather available. Fortunately DarkSky's API takes care of all that.
 
Improvements that could be made.
  1. Upgrading to Google's geolocation would allow for searching of other locations, so its not just local information. Not sure if its free. 
  2. DarkSky provides different API calls for weekly forecasts and things of that nature. Just more information and more robust if implemented.
  3. Get better at HTML,CSS, and JS (jQuery) in general
